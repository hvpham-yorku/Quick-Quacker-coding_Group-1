## Reflection
**1. What are practices that you should continue during next sprint?**
  - **Michael:** In the following sprints, I would like to continue dividing tasks to each team members strengths.
  - **Phoebe:** In future sprints, I would like to continue to read the project document as a group, it helps everyone have a clear idea on the workload needed to be done.
  - **Kristin:** If there was a next sprint, I would like to continue the frequent group meetings. They help the team stay on track and make sure the sprint flow is on time.
  - **Urgyen:** In the next sprint, I would like to continue the practice of people reaching out if someone needs help or is stuck.
  - **Amnol:** In the next sprint, I would like to continue the practice of letting other people check my code.

**2. What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint?**
  - **Michael:** I would like to have a universal naming standard
  - **Phoebe:** I would like to be more organized on github.
  - **Kristin:** I would like to start dividing the tasks more equally. 
  - **Urgyen:** I would like to be more punctual for in-person meetings.
  - **Amnol:** I would like to do far more testing frequently

**3. What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop during next sprint?**
  - **Michael:** Not having a universal naming standard across all files.
  - **Phoebe:** Not being organized on github, it looked quite cluttered at times.
  - **Kristin:** Not setting proper deadline for each task is something I think we can reduce.  
  - **Urgyen:** To stop being late to in-person meetings.
  - **Amnol:** Not completing tasks at specificed target dates

**4. What was your best/worst experience during Sprint 1?**
  - **Michael:** Best experince was seeing all the hard work of the team come together and  create a working website for users. 
  - **Phoebe:** My worst experience would have to be working on the database for the register and login as it took quite a while.
  - **Kristin:** My worst experience would have to be figuring out Jira since it's much more difficult to use than Trello. 
  - **Urgyen:** My worst experience would be being late to the in-person meetings.
  - **Amnol:** My worst expirence would be to do the testing of my features.
