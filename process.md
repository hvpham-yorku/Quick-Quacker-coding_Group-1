# Process
## ORGANIZATION
To organize the team we designated tasks to each member and tried to divide up the work so that not one person was doing all the work.
To collaborate on work we will be using github for version controls, figma for the UI/UX design,and discord to communicate with each other.

## DECISION MAKING
When decision-making for quick small choices it there were no objections to it we would move forward with the decision, when there were opinions that conflicted with each other we used a voting system for majority vote to win, and the team would consider the feasibility of some choices to determine if it could be done with the time given and technical capabilities. 

## PRIORITIZING USER STORIES
To decide which user stories were more important we picked the ones that most related to our core features such as being able to add tasks to the application. For the additional features we placed those on a lower priority since they are not apart of the core functionality of the application.

## MEETINGS
We met frequently, twice weekly after class and used discord when we couldn't meet in person. We would check in on progress or any issues/problems that arose to prevent someone from working.

## Next Phase
In the next phase we can take lessons such as improving our time management so that we could finish faster and stay on schedule. We could also improve communication where in meetings everyone can give an opinion, weekly checkups to make sure everyone is on track and is comfortable with what they are working on.
