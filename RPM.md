# Release Planning Meeting

## Release Goal
The primary goal of this release is to develop a functional task management system integrated with a virtual pet duck to enhance productivity through gamification. This release will provide users with an engaging interface that blends task management with interactive motivation.

## Scope of the Project
The scope includes the following key features: 

### Task Management System

Quick Quacker provides a fully functional task manager with essential features, including:
	
- **Task Creation & Organization:** Users can add, edit, and delete tasks with options for due
dates, priorities, and recurring schedules.

- **Quick Add Feature:** Allows for rapid task entry via a one-tap button or voice commands.

- **Task Categories & Labels:** Users can group tasks (e.g., Work, Health, Study) for better organization.

- **Reminders & Notifications:** The app provides real-time alerts and duck-themed notifications when tasks are due.

### Virtual Pet Duck System

The virtual pet aspect serves as an engaging productivity motivator:

- **Duck Evolution & Growth:** Completing tasks feeds the duck, allowing it to gain XP and evolve over time.

- **Behavioral Feedback & Mood System:** The duck responds dynamically to user behavior:

	- *Complete tasks consistently?* The duck is happy, active, and grows faster.

  	- *Neglect tasks?* The duck becomes sad, lazy, or unmotivated.

	- *Break a long streak?* The duck may refuse to evolve or throw tantrums.

- **Customization & Rewards:** Users earn “Quack Coins” for completing tasks, which can be used to buy hats, outfits, and accessories for their duck.

### Gamification & Rewards System

Quick Quacker transforms productivity into an interactive experience:

- **XP & Level System:** Users gain XP for each completed task, influencing how quickly their duck evolves.

- **Streaks & Achievement Badges:** Maintaining a daily streak unlocks exclusive duck evolutions, skins, or accessories.

- **Mini-Challenges & Quests:** Encourages users to complete goals like “Complete 5 tasks in a row” for special rewards.
	

### Productivity Insights & Tracking

Quick Quacker provides detailed analytics to help users track productivity trends:
- **Task Completion Rates:** Shows how many tasks were completed weekly/monthly.

- **Performance Graphs:** Visualizes productivity streaks and trends.
  
- **Habit Formation Tips:** The app provides personalized suggestions based on user patterns, such as:
  
	- *“You complete most tasks in the morning! Want to set morning reminders?”*
   
	- *“You’ve kept a 7-day streak! Keep going to unlock a rare evolution!”*

### Duck-Interactive Reminders & Sound Effects

To make task management more engaging, the app includes:

- **Quack Notifications:** The duck quacks to remind users about overdue tasks.
  
- **Interactive Feedback:** If a user ignores a task for too long, the duck may:
  
	- Send a funny notification (“I’m getting hungry… complete a task to feed me!”).
   
	- Refuse to evolve until a task is completed.
   
- **Customizable Sounds:** Users can choose from different quack styles (happy, robotic, dramatic).
