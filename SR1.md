## Unfinished Tasks and Stories 
- #2 As Anna Chen, I want to organize my tasks based on categories (work, study, and personal) so that I can stay focused and easily prioritize important tasks.

- #10 As a user, I want my duck’s quack notifications to adjust based on task urgency so that I can better prioritize my tasks.

- #11 As a user, I want to view task completion rates on a weekly or monthly basis so that I can track my productivity trends.

- #18 As a user, I want to complete mini-challenges so that I have additional motivation to stay productive.

- #19 As a user, I want to set recurring tasks so that I can stay on top of my routine responsibilities without having to re-enter them manually.

- #20 As a user, I want to customize my duck’s quack notifications such as sound styles so that reminders feel personalized and engaging.

- #14 As a user, I want to unlock special themed ducks based on my productivity habits so that my virtual pet reflects my personal progress and style.

- #15 As Ryan Mitchell, I want to receive reminders and notifications throughout the day to help me stay on track.

- #17 As a user, I want the app to provide task suggestions based on my past activity so that I can stay consistent with my productivity.
One practice that I want to continue is the open commuication within the group. When one is struggling on their part, we try to help each other out as best as possible.
